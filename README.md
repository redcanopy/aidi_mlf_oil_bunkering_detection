# aidi_mlf_oil_bunkering_detection

This repository contains a college project focused on detection sea vessels that might be engaged in illegal activities like oil bunkering or smuggling. The project uses Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from Marine Cadastre (https://hub.marinecadastre.gov/pages/vesseltraffic) and employs two unsupervised machine learning models (Isolation Forest and Autoencoders) to detect anomalies in ship movements.
